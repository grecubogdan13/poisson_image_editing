# poisson_image_editing
Implemented both versions of seamless cloning (importing gradients and mixing gradients), a gradient based editing method. It combines features of the target image, with those of the source. Using this, we can insert in a source image a target image, and make it look natural, by using the equations presented in the paper Poisson image editing by P. PÂ´erez, M. Gangnet, and A. Blake (SIGGRAPH 2003). <br>
This repo represents my submission for the third coursework at COMP0026 Image Processing. You can read more details about the requirements in the pdf file. <br>
Note: For the 4 th exercise, I implemented Local color changes
